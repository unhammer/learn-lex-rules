Since nob-sme is not developed at all, we do (in apertium-sme-nob)
: make nob-sme
: cp /path/to/apertium-nob/nob.automorf.bin nob-sme.automorf.bin
which puts the untrimmed nob analyser in sme-nob.

irstlm requires boost; on Ubuntu, do
: sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

* TODO nob-side tag trimming needs work
<pers>/<impers> shouldn't be in the nopardefs dictionary (are there other such?)

* TODO should probably have deps in a separate makefile
